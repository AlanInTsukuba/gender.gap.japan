<h1>Gender Gap Japan</h1>

<div class="abstract"><p>Objective: Apply segregation statistics to government data around and about Tsukuba.
</p>
  <p class="abstract">A recently published decomposition method (Elbers, 2021) enables 
    changes in segregation to be decomposed into changes resulting from new units 
    (for example, occupations), disappearing units, changes in groups (for example, gender), 
    changes in units, and structural changes. Elbers has released an R package with 
    clearly written vignette and 
  documentation. This project will apply this and other segregation statistics methods 
  to gender gaps in Japan using readily available census and other government statistics.</p>

<h4><a href="basic/OccupationGenderWalkthrough01.html">Basic walkthrough of Elbers's segregation package 
using Japanese population census data</a></h4>
<p>Elbers's R package "segregation" contains a detailed vignette 
(https://elbersb.github.io/segregation/articles/segregation.html) 
that steps through the main features of his package. This basic walkthrough uses data on occupation versus gender from 
the 1995 and 2000 Japan Population Censuses.</p>

<h4>Reproduction of Uchikoshi and Mugiyama (2020) with extension</h4>
<p>Brinton and Ngo (1993) published a landmark study of gender and occupation in Japan. Uchikoshi 
  and Mugiyama (2020) look at subsequent trends at a more detailed minor occupation level. The latter 
  constructed a occupational crosswalk that covers Japanese population censuses 
  that were conducted between 1980 and 2005, and rely mainly on the Duncan dissimilarity index 
  as their measure of segregation. The objective of this subproject is to partially reproduce the Uchikoshi 
  and Mugiyama (2020) results, then compare them to results using Elbers's decomposition.

<!--<p>The Statistics Bureau of Japan (SBJ) provides occupation vs gender data from 1995 and 2000 population censuses 
in combined tables that have national totals only. Released data for the 2005 population censuses additionally details 
this data by prefecture and a few major cities. It doesn't get us to Tsukuba, but at it does let us look at Ibaraki 
prefecture. In addition, the data breaks out occupations by whether the respondents are self-employed, employed in family 
businesses, and employed by others. This may be useful in looking a occupations in which free-lancing and other forms 
of self-employment are of interest.</p>-->

  <li><h4><a href="basic/PreprocessingTheData.html">Preprocessing the data</a></h4>
  <p>Data downloaded from e-Stat usually must be processed before it can be incorporated into statistics 
    packages or, in this case, used for constructing an occupational crosswalk. Instead of the 2005 data 
    downloaded in the previous step, here I use 2000 data because it has a "feature" that is not in the 2005 data and 
    must be corrected.
