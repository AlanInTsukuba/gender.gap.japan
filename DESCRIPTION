Description: "Objective: Apply segregation statistics to Japanese government data A recently published decomposition method (Elbers, 2021) enables 
changes in segregation to be decomposed into changes resulting from new units 
(for example, occupations), disappearing units, changes in groups (for example, gender), 
changes in units, and structural changes. Elbers has released an R package with 
clearly written vignette and documentation. This project will apply this and 
other segregation statistics methods to gender gaps in Japan using readily 
available census and other government statistics."
