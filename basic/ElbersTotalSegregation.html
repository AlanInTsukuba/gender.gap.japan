<h1>Applying Elbers: Total segregation</h1>
<p class="author"><a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0070-2347" target="_blank">Alan Engel</a><br>Last update: 
14 December 2021</p>
<main>
    <p>Elbers (2021) derives a five-term decomposition: 
        $$S(t_{2})-S(t_{1})=\Delta_{appearing}+\Delta_{disappearing}$$
    $$+\Delta_{marginal-units}+\Delta_{marginal-groups}$$
$$+\sum_{u\in t_{1}\cap t_{2}}\Delta_{i,structural}$$
where \(S(t)\) is a segregation index value at time t, 
\(\Delta_{appearing}\) is the number of units (e.g., occupations) that newly 
appeared between time \(t_{1}\) and \(t_{2}\), \(\Delta_{disappearing}\) 
is the number of units that disappeared, \(\Delta_{marginal-units}\) 
is the marginal change due to units, and \(\Delta_{marginal-groups}\) is 
that due to groups (for example, genders). The last term is the structural 
("pure") segregation that occurs within each unit. </p>
<p>When written in this 
form, the Uchikoshi and Mugiyama (2020) [UM2020] decomposition of a change in 
Duncans' Dissimilarity Index becomes:
$$S(t_{2})-S(t_{1})=\Delta_{marginal-units}+\sum_{u\in t_{1}\cap t_{2}}\Delta_{i,structural}$$</p>
<p>In UM2020 the segregation index is Duncans' Dissimilarity Index. 
</p>
<p>Elbers uses Thiel's H index:
    $$H=\frac{M}{E(p_{g})}$$ where M is the Mutual Information Index and \(E(p_{g})\) is the 
    group (gender) entropy. This task follows the analysis that Elbers (2021) provides in his 
    supplementary materials.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the decomposition of total H and M into the segregation 
    between the major groups and the weighted sum of segregations within the major 
    groups. H is a standardized index with a range from 0 (no segregation) to 1 (complete 
    segregation). M has a minimum of 0 for no segregation; its maximum value is the entropy, 
    which is the value of the M at complete segregation. The results show sustained high levels 
    of segregation in the specialist and technical occupations, and sharply decreasing 
    segregation in transportation and communications occupations. Managerial workers and 
    manufacturing workers, operators and laborers show gradually decreasing segregation. Sales 
    occupations show that segregation increased in the period from 1990 to 1995, which started 
    in Japan's bubble economy and ended in its "lost decade." These major groups will be 
    analyzed in more detail later in this project.

        <figcaption>Occupational gender segregation 1985-2005</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When the changes in M between 1985 and 2005 are decomposed into the 5 components, structural, 
    gender margins, occupational margins, appearing occupations and disappearing occupations, we 
    that structural segregation decreased overall and in most of the major occupational groups. 
    At the total labor force level, decreases in segregation due to structural changes and occupational 
    marginal changes appears to have been offset by gender marginal changes. In the main group with 
    the largest decrease in segregation, transportation and communications workes, the change 
    was mostly due changes in occupational composition.
