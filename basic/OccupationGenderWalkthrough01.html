<h1>Basic walkthrough of Elbers's segregation package using Japanese population census data</h1>

<p>This walkthough follows <a href="https://elbersb.github.io/segregation/articles/segregation.html" 
target="_blank">Elbers's</a> closely, to the extent that sections of his text are copied verbatim. This is so 
readers can concentrate on the mathematics and data without getting hung up on linguistics.</p>
<blockquote>The segregation package includes functionality to calculate entropy-based segregation measures, 
namely the Mutual Information Index (M) and the Theil Index (H), which is a normalized version of the M index. 
The package also includes several methods for decomposing the index into between/within components and into 
local segregation scores, as well as methods to decompose differences in segregation indices. 
All of these methods have arguments to obtain standard errors and confidence intervals through bootstrapping.

<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#the-basic-mathematics" class="anchor"></a>The basic mathematics</h2>
<p>The idea of a segregation index is to summarize a contingency table to a single number. For instance, we may have a table with <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> units, say schools or occupations, and <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> groups, say gender or racial groups. For each combination of unit and group we have a count, <span class="math inline">\(t_{ug}\)</span>. Arranged in a <span class="math inline">\(U\times G\)</span> matrix <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}\)</span>, this is what the structure of the data looks like:</p>
<table class="table">
<thead><tr class="header">
<th align="center"></th>
<th align="center"><span class="math inline">\(g=1\)</span></th>
<th align="center">…</th>
<th align="center"><span class="math inline">\(g=G\)</span></th>
</tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(u=1\)</span></td>
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(t_{11}\)</span></td>
<td align="center">…</td>
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(t_{1G}\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(u=2\)</span></td>
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(t_{21}\)</span></td>
<td align="center">…</td>
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(t_{2G}\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(u=3\)</span></td>
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(t_{31}\)</span></td>
<td align="center">…</td>
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(t_{3G}\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td align="center">…</td>
<td align="center">…</td>
<td align="center">…</td>
<td align="center">…</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(u=U\)</span></td>
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(t_{U1}\)</span></td>
<td align="center">…</td>
<td align="center"><span class="math inline">\(t_{UG}\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>From this matrix, we can define <span class="math inline">\(t=\sum_{u=1}^U\sum_{g=1}^G t_{ug}\)</span>, the total population size. The joint probability of being in unit <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> and racial group <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(p_{ug}=t_{ug}/t\)</span>. Also define <span class="math inline">\(p_{u \cdot}=\sum_{g=1}^{G}t_{ug}/t\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_{\cdot g}=\sum_{u=1}^{U}t_{ug}/t\)</span> as the marginal probabilities of units and groups, respectively. The <strong>Mutual Information Index</strong> is then defined as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
M(\mathbf{T})=\sum_{u=1}^U\sum_{g=1}^Gp_{ug}\log\frac{p_{ug}}{p_{u \cdot}p_{\cdot g}}.
\]</span> The <strong>Theil Index</strong> is closely related to the M index, as it is just a normalized version of the Mutual Information Index:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H(\mathbf{T})=\frac{M(\mathbf{T})}{E(\mathbf{T})},
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(E(\mathbf{T})\)</span> denotes the entropy of the group marginal distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(E(\mathbf{T})=-\sum_{g=1}^{G}p_{\cdot g}\log p_{\cdot g}\)</span>. Dividing through the group entropy has the effect of constraining H to be between 0 and 1.</p>

<h2>Data and data format</h2>
<p>Elbers's <a href="https://elbersb.github.io/segregation/articles/segregation.html" 
target="_blank">walkthrough</a> uses data about racial groups and schools. 
<a href="https://osf.io/8uyej/" target="_blank">Supplemental materials</a> for Elbers (2021) contain and example 
applied to occupational segregation.</p>
<p>This walkthrough uses data about gender and 
occupation taken from the 1995 and 2000 Japan Population Censuses. This dataset can be downloaded from 
this project's <a href="https://github.com/AlanInTsukuba/tsukuba-segregation/tree/main/inst/extdata">repository</a>. 
The original data for this dataset is from <a href="https://www.e-stat.go.jp/stat-search/files?page=1&layout=datalist&toukei=00200521&tstat=000000030001&cycle=0&tclass1=000000030439&tclass2=000000030440&tclass3=000000030441&stat_infid=000000034D0D&tclass4val=0" 
target="blank">e-Stat</a>. </p>
<p>Elbers's segregation package uses data in columnar (aka, long) format. Columnar format is avaiable for 
Japanese Population Censuses conducted in 2010 and 2015, but not for earlier years. The dataset in this repository 
was reformatted from 1995 and 2000 census data; the English occupation titles were obtained from the 
<a href="https://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/kokusei/2000/syokugyo.html" target="blank">Statistics Bureau of 
Japan</a>.</p>
<p>The R code below loads the segregation library and then reads the data into data frame <i>occgen</i>. The 
first column of <i>occgen</i> contains the census year. The next three columns list different levels of the 
occupation classification. There are 10 top level classes, 61 mid-level groups, and 293 bottom level groups. 
The SBJ classification also subdivides top level I (PRODUCTION PROCESS WORKERS AND LABOURERS) into 3 subclasses. 
Including the total of all occupations, there are a total of 5 levels. This workthrough will ignore the 3 subclasses of I. 
(This organization may seem odd to some readers, but allows direct copying of the census table into the csv file.)</p>

<h2>Computing M and H indices</h2>
<p>Use <a href="https://elbersb.github.io/segregation/reference/mutual_total.html" target="blank">mutual_total()</a> to 
compute M and H.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">#' Compute M and H indices

#>    stat       est
#> 1:    M 0.1921583
#> 2:    H 0.2856683
</code></pre>
<p>M is not normalized so cannot be easily interpreted, but H is normalized and ranges between 0 and 1. 
Elbers (2021) looked at occupational gender segregation in the United States between 1990 and 2016. For 369 
occupations in 1990, he found an H of 31%, a value not very different from the 29% for 292 occupations in Japan 
in 1995.</p>
<p>H depends on the order of the groups and units in 
<a href="https://elbersb.github.io/segregation/reference/mutual_total.html" target="blank">mutual_total()</a>. 
Switching their order changes the H index, but not the M index.</p>

<h2>Between-Within decomposition</h2>
<p>In his walkthough, Elbers looks at segregation by state. In Elbers(2021), he looks at gender 
segregation by major occupation group in the United States. Here I look at gender segregation 
by major occupational group in Japan using <i>occgen95</i>, just showing the M for simplicity.</p>

<p>Major group A, professional and technical workers, is the most segregated of the major 
groups. Groups D, sales workers; I_1, manufacturers; and I_3, mining and construction workers 
show more moderate levels of segregation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the advantages of entropy-based segregation indices is that these three state-specific 
indices have a simple relationship to the overall index. This is called the between/within decomposition: 
Total segregation can be decomposed into a term that measures how much the distribution of racial groups 
differs <em>between</em> states, and into a term that measures segregation <em>within</em> states. If we 
have <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> states (or “super-units” more generally), where each school 
belongs to exactly one state, the M index can be decomposed as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
M(\mathbf{T})=M(\mathbf{S}) + \sum_{s=1}^S p_s M(\mathbf{T}_s),
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}\)</span> is the full <span class="math inline">\(U \times G\)</span> contingency table, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span> is the aggregated contingency table of dimension <span class="math inline">\(S\times G\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p_s\)</span> is the population proportion of state <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> (such that <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{s=1}^S p_s=1\)</span>), and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}_s\)</span> is the subset of rows of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{T}\)</span> belonging to state <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. Put in simple terms, the M index can be decomposed into a between-state segregation index, plus a weighted average of within-state M indices.</p>
<p>For the H index, we are dividing the above formula by <span class="math inline">\(E(\mathbf{T})\)</span>. This makes the formula a bit more complicated, because the normalization has to be offset in the decomposition:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H(\mathbf{T})=H(\mathbf{S}) + \sum_{s=1}^S \frac{E(\mathbf{T}_s)}{E(\mathbf{T})} p_s H(\mathbf{T}_s),
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(E(\cdot)\)</span> is again the entropy of the marginal group distribution. Note that <span class="math inline">\(E(\mathbf{T})=E(\mathbf{S})\)</span>, because the group marginal distributions are identical.</p>

<p>In this walkthrough, I substitute gender for race, occupations for schools, and major occupational groups for 
states. </p>

<p>This shows, for example, that the professional and technical occupations (A) contribute 20% of 
the total segregation even though they hold only 13% of employees.</p>

<p>Elbers further provides a decomposition of the M index that lets us look at segregation in individual units 
(occupations, schools) and groups (gender, race).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The M index (but not the H index) allows for another decomposition, into local segregation scores. To define this decomposition, let <span class="math inline">\(p_{g|u} = t_{ug} / t_{u \cdot}\)</span> be the conditional probability of being in group <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, given that one is in unit <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. We can then define the <em>local segregation score of unit <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span></em> as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L_u = \sum_{g=1}^G p_{g|u}\log\frac{p_{g|u}}{p_{\cdot g}}\]</span> The weighted average of the <span class="math inline">\(L_u\)</span> is again <span class="math inline">\(M(\mathbf{T})\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(M(\mathbf{T}) = \sum_{u=1}^U p_{u\cdot}L_u\)</span>.</p>
<p>To obtain the local segregation scores <span class="math inline">\(L_u\)</span>, along with the marginal 
weights <span class="math inline">\(p_{u\cdot}\)</span>, 
use <code><a href="https://elbersb.github.io/segregation/reference/mutual_local.html" target="blank">mutual_local()</a></code>:</p>

<p>The output gives a segregation score (ls) for each of the 292 detailed occupations and the share 
of people in each occupation (p). The shares sum to 1. And the sum of the local weighted 
segregation scores equals the <a href="#totalseg">total segregation</a>.</p>

<p>As analyses become more detailed, sample sizes also shrink and confidence intervals demand more 
attention. The following code computes and plots the 95% confidence intervals in relation to the 
size (p) of each occupation.</p>
