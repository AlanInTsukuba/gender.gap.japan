<h1>Basic walkthrough of Elbers's segregation package using Japanese population census data</h1>

<p>This walkthough follows <a href="https://elbersb.github.io/segregation/articles/segregation.html" 
target="_blank">Elbers's</a> closely, to the extent that sections of his text are copied verbatim. This is so 
readers can concentrate on the mathematics and data without getting hung up on linguistics.</p>
<blockquote>The segregation package includes functionality to calculate entropy-based segregation measures, 
namely the Mutual Information Index (M) and the Theil Index (H), which is a normalized version of the M index. 
The package also includes several methods for decomposing the index into between/within components and into 
local segregation scores, as well as methods to decompose differences in segregation indices. 
All of these methods have arguments to obtain standard errors and confidence intervals through bootstrapping.
